description: Documentation for bridging assets to Base. This page covers how to bridge assets between Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and Base.

---

Base supports bridging assets from multiple chains including Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. While the bridge on bridge.base.org has been deprecated, there are many bridges that support moving assets between Base and other chains.

For questions, see our [FAQ](#faq).

---

## Ethereum ↔ Base

### Superbridge

Superbridge enables you to bridge ETH and other supported assets from Ethereum mainnet (L1) directly to Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://superbridge.app/base)
- [Base Sepolia (Testnet)](https://superbridge.app/base-sepolia)

### Brid.gg

Brid.gg is another option that also helps you bridge ETH and supported assets between Ethereum mainnet (L1) and Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://brid.gg/base)
- [Base Sepolia (Testnet)](https://testnet.brid.gg/base-sepolia)

### Programmatic Bridging (Ethereum)

See the [sample code repository](https://github.com/base-org/guides/tree/main/bridge/native) to see how to bridge ETH and ERC-20s from Ethereum to Base.

<Warning>
**Double check the token address for ERC-20s** You can use any ERC-20 that is
supported on the network. You can check what assets are on Base and the
corresponding contract address via [this hub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data).
Ensure there is an address for `base`, [example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/blob/master/data/WETH/data.json#L16-L18).
Always test with small amounts to ensure the system is working as expected.
</Warning>

<Warning>
This implementation can only bridge assets to Base. Do not attempt to alter the
code to withdraw the assets.
</Warning>

### For Token Issuers

If you have an ERC-20 token deployed on Ethereum and want to enable bridging to Base, see our guide on [Bridging an L1 Token to Base](/base-chain/quickstart/bridge-token). This covers deploying your token on Base using the standard bridge contracts and getting it listed on the Superchain token list.

## Solana ↔ Base

The Base-Solana bridge enables bidirectional token transfers and message passing between Base and Solana networks.

**Key Features:**
- Transfer SOL and SPL tokens between Base and Solana
- Send arbitrary cross-chain messages
- Deploy wrapped tokens on either chain
- Optional auto-relay for instant execution

## Bitcoin → Base

### Garden

Garden is a fast non-custodial Bitcoin bridge that enables you to bridge BTC and other supported assets from Ethereum, Solana, and more, directly to Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://app.garden.finance/?output-chain=base&output-asset=cbBTC)
- [Base Sepolia (Testnet)](https://testnet.garden.finance/?output-chain=base_sepolia&output-asset=USDT)

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Can I still use the bridge on bridge.base.org?">
No, the bridge on bridge.base.org has been deprecated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I used bridge.base.org in the past, how do I find my deposit or withdrawal?">
Navigate to one of the Superchain Bridges to look up your transaction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why has Base deprecated the bridge on bridge.base.org?">
Base is committed to decentralization and the Superchain vision. Leveraging the community to bootstrap the Superchain bridges is a step in that direction; increasing censorship resistance and decentralization.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Who operates the Superchain Bridges like Garden.finance, Superbridge.app and Brid.gg?">
Superchain Bridges are operated by third parties, not by Coinbase Technologies, Inc. ("Coinbase"). Coinbase does not control, operate, or assume any responsibility for the performance of these external platforms. Before using any Superchain Bridge, you may be required to agree to their terms and conditions. We strongly recommend you review these terms carefully, as well as any privacy policies, to understand your rights and obligations. The integration or inclusion of the Superchain Bridges does not imply an endorsement or recommendation of any bridge by Coinbase.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the Base-Solana bridge work?">
The Base-Solana bridge uses validators to verify cross-chain messages. When bridging from Solana to Base, tokens are locked on Solana and minted on Base. When bridging from Base to Solana, tokens are burned on Base and unlocked on Solana. See the [full documentation](/base-chain/quickstart/base-solana-bridge) for implementation details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I have a question, issue, or problem?">
The [Base Discord](https://base.org/discord) community is available around the clock for general questions,
assistance and support! You can create a support ticket in the #general-support
channel.
